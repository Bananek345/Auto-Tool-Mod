**AutoToolMod** automatically selects the most efficient tool from your hotbar for the block you are currently mining. It instantly detects the block type and switches to your shovel, pickaxe, or axe to speed up your work. If no suitable tool is found, it does nothing to avoid unnecessary item swapping.

You can toggle the mod on or off anytime by pressing the **Right Shift** key. Status messages will appear above your action bar to confirm the current state.
